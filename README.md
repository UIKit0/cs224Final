TODO: 
Optimizations:
    LOD management for the particles
    Don't always render particles when very close to the screen (and thus take up a good portion of the screen)
    Smarter noise, maybe only calculate noise every few frames, it's supposed to be continuous right?

Smoke shading effects (mjm9?)
Particle code refactoring and generification (jw19)
More smoke sprites (jw19/ayidi)
Advanced toon shading (ayidi)

Alpha sampling blending thing (mjm9)
